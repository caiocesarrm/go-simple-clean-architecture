# Simple implementation Clean Architecture in Golang.

Uncle Bob (Clean Architecture creator) told that he had the idea of Clean Architecture when he saw a Ruby on Rails project and in seconds he knew that it was a Rails project.
Problem is: Many Clean Architecture implementations out there are framework/lib agnostic, sometimes not even depend on interfaces.
Another problem that i see is that the http server is considered the only entrypoint to the business logic, with the http server on the project root.
The idea is to implement 3 entrypoints to domain: Http server, Grpc and async workers with kafka or rabbitmq.

I apologize in advance for any errors, leave your corrections, suggestions and improvements.
