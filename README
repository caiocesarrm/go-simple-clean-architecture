# Simple implementation Clean Architecture in Golang.

Uncle Bob (Clean Architecture creator) told that he had the idea of Clean Architecture when he saw a Ruby on Rails project and in seconds he knew that it was a Rails project.
Problem is: Many Clean Architecture implementations out there aren't framework/lib agnostic, it's not clear that they are using this pattern. 
Sometimes the file structure indeed suggest a Clean Architecture implementation but with severe flaws like not depending on interfaces.
Another problem that i see is that the http server is considered the only entrypoint to the business logic, with the http server on the project root.
The idea is that the delivery mechanism can be a console application, a http server, a desktop application, etc...
The idea is to implement 3 entrypoints: Http server, Grpc and async workers with kafka or rabbitmq.

I apologize in advance for any errors, leave your corrections, suggestions and improvements.
